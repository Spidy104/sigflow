SigFlow is a hybrid C++/Python sandbox for simulating wireless channels, generating synthetic IQ datasets, engineering RF features, and training ensemble classifiers for modulation recognition. The C++20 DSP core (FFTW3, Eigen3, pybind11) synthesizes Rayleigh/Rician fading, AWGN, and Doppler impairments; Python utilities orchestrate dataset generation, feature extraction, experimentation, and visualization.

## Quickstart

1. **Clone & submodules**

	```bash
	git clone https://github.com/Spidy104/sigflow.git
	cd sigflow
	```

2. **Install prerequisites**

   - CMake ≥ 3.24, Ninja (optional but faster), a C++20 compiler (clang++ 14+/g++ 11+)
   - FFTW3 (double precision) and Eigen3 development headers
   - Python 3.10 with `numpy`, `scipy`, `scikit-learn`, `pandas`, `matplotlib`, `h5py`

3. **Build + validate**

	```bash
	cmake -S libdsp -B libdsp/build -GNinja -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
	cmake --build libdsp/build
	python validate_core.py
	```

## Architecture at a glance

- **DSP core (`libdsp/`)** – C++20 modules for signal synthesis, fading channels, noise models, and feature extraction exposed to Python via pybind11.
- **Python pipeline (`python_src/`)** – dataset generation, feature computation, ML training, evaluation, and helper utilities.
- **Experiments & notebooks** – quick scripts (`ber_*.py`, `run_demo.py`) plus `python_src/training.ipynb` for exploratory model development.
- **Tests** – CTest targets exercise the C++ core, while Python smoke tests ensure bindings and utilities run end-to-end.

## Repository layout

| `test_all.py` | Convenience launcher that runs CTest and Python smoke tests in one go. |
| `test_channel_simple.py` | Lightweight Python check for channel bindings without full dataset generation. |
| `validate_core.py` | Ensures the compiled `libdsp` module can be imported and basic transforms succeed. |

## Requirements & setup

1. Install FFTW3 and Eigen3 packages (e.g., `sudo apt install libfftw3-dev libeigen3-dev`).
2. Install pybind11 headers (`pip install pybind11` or distribution packages).
3. Create and activate a Python 3.10 virtual environment, then install Python dependencies:

	```bash
	python -m venv .venv
	source .venv/bin/activate
	pip install -r requirements.txt  # coming soon; for now install packages listed above
	```

4. Export `PYTHONPATH` to include `python_src` if running scripts directly outside the repo root.

## Building the C++ core

```bash
cmake -S libdsp -B libdsp/build \
  -GNinja \
  -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release \
  -DPYBIND11_FINDPYTHON=ON
cmake --build libdsp/build
ctest --test-dir libdsp/build --output-on-failure
```

Tips:

- Pass `-DBUILD_SHARED_LIBS=ON` if you prefer shared artifacts.
- Use `-DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH` to point CMake to non-system FFTW3/Eigen installs.
- The generated `libdsp.cpython-*.so` lives in `libdsp/build/src/`; `validate_core.py` dynamically adds it to `sys.path`.

## Dataset + feature generation

| Command | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `python python_src/smoke_test_generate.py` | Generates a small dataset + feature matrix to validate the full pipeline. |
| `python ber_sweep.py --snr 0 20 2` | Sweeps BER over 0–20 dB in 2 dB steps (arguments optional). |
| `python python_src/extract_features.py --dataset results/full_dataset/dataset.npz` | Converts IQ captures into engineered features. |

Artifacts end up in `results/` (ignored by git). Update `python_src/config.py` to change SNR grids, modulation families, or dataset sizes.

## Training classifiers

- Open `python_src/training.ipynb` to explore feature importance, grid-search hyperparameters, and evaluate baseline models (Random Forest, XGBoost, LightGBM).
- For scripted training, use `python python_src/ml_inference.py --train --config configs/baseline.yaml` (placeholder config – adapt to your environment).
- Save trained models in `results/models/` and point inference scripts to that directory using CLI flags or config entries.

## Inference & demos

```bash
python run_demo.py --snr 10 --modulation qpsk
python python_src/ml_inference.py --model results/models/best.joblib --features results/full_dataset/features.npz
```

The demo script generates a synthetic channel trace, feeds it through the trained model, and prints/logs predicted modulation classes. Use `--plot` to enable matplotlib visualizations when running locally.

## CLI reference

| Script | Highlights |
| --- | --- |
| `validate_core.py` | Imports `libdsp`, runs FFT/BER sanity checks, and prints summary stats. |
| `test_all.py` | Calls CTest plus Python smoke tests; convenient pre-commit gate. |
| `ber_test_correct.py` | Compares empirical BER to closed-form curves; fails fast if drift detected. |
| `ber_test_with_equalization.py` | Runs the BER suite with and without equalization for regression tracking. |
| `diagnose_fading.py` | Dumps fading taps, Doppler spectra, and coherence times to CSV/plots. |

Run any script with `-h/--help` to see available options.

## Testing & validation

1. **C++ unit tests** – `ctest --test-dir libdsp/build` after configuring the build.
2. **Python smoke** – `python python_src/smoke_test_generate.py` ensures bindings and config defaults still work.
3. **Full-stack** – `python test_all.py` to run both suites sequentially; integrate with CI before pushing.

## Documentation & resources

- `theory.md` – derivations for BER curves, fading PDFs, and assumptions used in simulations.
- `results/logs.csv` + `results/fading_impact.csv` – example outputs referenced in the paper notebook.

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Fix |
| --- | --- |
| `ModuleNotFoundError: libdsp` | Ensure `cmake --build` succeeded and the generated `.so` is on `PYTHONPATH`. `validate_core.py` temporarily amends `sys.path`; mimic that behavior in custom scripts. |
| `Could NOT find FFTW3` | Install `libfftw3-dev` or set `FFTW3_DIR`. Use `cmake -DFFTW3_DIR=/opt/fftw`. |
| Numerical drift in BER curves | Rebuild in Release mode, verify RNG seeds in `python_src/config.py`, and rerun `ber_test_correct.py`. |
| Matplotlib backend errors on headless servers | Export `MPLBACKEND=Agg` or run scripts with `--no-plot`. |
